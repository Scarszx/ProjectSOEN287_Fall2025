Installation guide and user guide: To install the website, just download all html files, css and javascript files from the folder since we don't have a backend yet. To start as an user, you can find all the html files inside index.html. You will first have to create an account in create_account.html then go into login with login_page.html , since we don't have the back end yet ready we will open page 1 (for students) or page 2 (for the management) from there we will have different links for reservations and all . lastly we have a campus_booking_system.html that is not yet fully integrated to the system we hope to integrate it next time
